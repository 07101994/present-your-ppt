Present your PPT is a great app to open and view your PPT files in your android smartphone on the go. We are further interested to make this app more feature rich so that the users can feel the power of this app.

Features:
- Light weight app, requires less storage space.
- Open PPT files directly from your file explorer.
- Fast and fluid experience.
- Zoom in/out option.
- Navigate through slides through gestures.

We are looking to add further more features in this app:
- Integrate Material design.
- Gallery to list all PPT files.
- Support for PPTX files.
- Gestures for zoom in/out functionality.
- Intent filter bug for file when opened from sdcard.(File path is not found)
- Improve code to use design patterns and android app architecture practices.
